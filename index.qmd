Hello! I’m Nik Agarwal and this is my blog about cycling and data science.

Currently, I work at [MākuSafe](https://www.makusafe.com) where my work focuses on human activity recognition, modeling worker exertion, and developing automated analytic reports for stakeholders. I'm also an adjunct instructor for University of Wisconsin - Madsion leading their courses in the [Data Science & Analytics](https://digitalskills.wisc.edu/data-science-and-analytics-bootcamp/) bootcamp.

Previously, I worked at John Deere in various roles across multiple divisions & teams. My work there included process engineering/optimization, market basket analysis, developing models to predict machine failure, and modeling customer behavior.

I have a Master's in Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu/).
