Hi! My name is Nik and this is my personal blog.

I am a data scientist and I also teach as an adjunct instructor. 

I have a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from Northern Illinois University and a Master's in Data Science from Northwestern University.

In my free time, I enjoy **cycling** (I'm actually serious about this), learning to **cook**, and playing **board games** with the family.
