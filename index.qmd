Hi! My name is Nik and this is my personal blog.

I'm a data scientist and currently am Director of Data Science at [MƒÅkuSafe](https://www.makusafe.com) where I work on developing the overall data strategy and products and an Adjunct Instructor at [Southern New Hampshire University](https://www.snhu.edu).

I have a Master's in Data Science from Northwestern University.

In my free time (which is scarce), I enjoy **cycling** (I'm actually serious about this), learning to **cook**, and playing **board games** with the family.
