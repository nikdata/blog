## It all started with a new bike

About 2.5 years ago (summer of 2022 to be more precise), I purchased a [2022 BMC Roadmachine Two](https://us.bmc-switzerland.com/collections/bike-archive-road/products/roadmachine-two-bikes-bmc-22-10605-002?_pos=15&_fid=b81251584&_ss=c). At the time, it was a very expensive purchase and over the last 2 years, I've upgraded many of the components. Since this was the most expensive bike I ever bought in my life, I told myself that I'm going to get better at cycling. Great! Now how would I go about doing that?

## Get the right sensors

I remember that with my new bike, I wanted to make sure it had all the tech on it. I went ahead and bought a new Garmin Edge head unit, a speed sensor, and power meter pedals. Was I having a mid-life crisis? You betcha! And at this point, I still had no idea what I was going to do with all of these sensors and data points. 

## Hire a Coach?

Like many sports, I could work with a coach. I looked up cycling coaches (online and local ones) and I was overwhelmed. First off, hiring a coach is not cheap. Having a coach is a true commitment and a very costly endeavor if you don't maximize the benefits the coach offers you. And coaches are not your parents; their job is to help you succeed. Ultimately, you - as the athlete - have to put in the work. The coaches that I found were charging anywhere from $250 to well over $1000 per month.

I knew I wasn't going to train for a race or a cycling event. So I scratched this off my list.

## Why even worry about this?

Now that I had an expensive bike, I wanted to take advantage of it. Part of it also was that I wanted to be able to keep up with some of my friends. 

## But I learned something

Every coach started off with one question that really got me thinking: "what's your goal?"

When I first read that question (or variations of it), I didn't really think about it. My answer would always be "I want to ride my bike fast!" But I didn't take the time to think about my own goal. What did I really want to do? What about cycling excites me? 

## What I thought I wanted

Like almost everyone, I just wanted to go blazing fast on my bike. My ideal scenario would be taking a "bike lift" to the top of a big hill/mountain and just riding down at top speed. Or the next best scenario: flat road (absolutely no ups/downs) with no head wind ever and going fast! So yeah, just going fast is what I *thought* I wanted.

## What I really wanted

When I got my bike, I would ride as much as I could. I quickly realized that I was pretty tired out after riding for just 10-15 miles. Sure, I wasn't fit - that's why I needed to get better. But I was riding my bike frequently, why wasn't I getting any better? I also learned that there is a technical term for being tired: [bonking](https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/what-is-bonking-causes-dangers-and-prevention/#:~:text=Bonking%20is%20a%20dreaded%20experience,it%20is%20to%20recover%20from.). But I also came to the realization that I wasn't riding correctly. It wasn't always the form. Rather, I didn't know how to pace myself.

What I really wanted was to be able to **ride for 2 - 3 hours without bonking**. I wanted to have energy after my bike ride to do household work, spend time with my family, and feel good.
